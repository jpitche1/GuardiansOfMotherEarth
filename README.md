# Guardians Of Mother Earth

Guardians of Mother Earth is a scrolling shooter developed for a game design class project at UNCC as a collaborative effort from Donovan Weldon, Aaron Burgin, Jasmin Pitcher, and Martin Cullen. 

The theme for this project is sustainability. We chose to make our game about poaching and its negative impact on endangered species and ecosystems. Play as Obsidian, a gorilla who broke out of a genetic testing facility and returned to the safari to find his home overrun by nefarious poachers. Help Obsidian evade and defeat the poachers, break his friends out of hidden cages, and save his habitat. 

We used GameMaker Studio 2 to develop Guardians of Mother Earth. The project is implemented in GML. In the future, this project could be expanded by adding new rooms, species of animals to free, and poachers with new behaviors.
